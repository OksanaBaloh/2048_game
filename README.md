# 2048 Game

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. The gameâ€™s objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.

## Description

When the user clicks the "start" button, the board is cleared, and two tiles with either a value of 2 or 4 are added to the board. The user can then move the tiles by pressing the arrow keys on their keyboard. If two tiles with the same value are adjacent to each other and move in the same direction, they merge into a single tile with twice the value. The game is over when there are no more empty tiles on the board or when the player reaches a tile with a value of 2048.
